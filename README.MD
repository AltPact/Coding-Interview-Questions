# Coding Questions Showcase Repository

Welcome to the **Coding Questions Showcase Repository**! üöÄ

This repository has been created with the primary goal of showcasing my coding abilities by providing solutions to a wide range of popular coding questions. Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or just someone interested in honing your coding skills, you've come to the right place.

## Purpose

In the world of software development, problem-solving skills and coding proficiency are highly valued. This repository serves as a testament to my dedication and competence in tackling various coding challenges, from algorithmic problems to data structures and beyond.

## What to Expect

Inside this repository, you will find a collection of well-documented code solutions, explanations, and analyses for a diverse set of coding questions. These questions are drawn from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, and many others. Each solution has been carefully crafted to demonstrate not only the correctness of the code but also the efficiency and readability of the solution.

## How to Navigate

In this repository, each folder corresponds to a specific programming language, and within each folder, you'll find individual files, each containing a method that provides a solution to one of the coding interview questions layed out in the section below.
This structured organization allows for easy navigation and access to solutions tailored to various programming languages.

Feel free to explore the repository and dive into the coding questions that interest you the most. You can browse the code, read the explanations, and even run the code locally to see it in action. If you have any questions or feedback on the solutions, don't hesitate to reach out.

## Contributions

While the primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding skills, I welcome constructive contributions and suggestions from the community. If you have an improvement or an alternative solution to a problem, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration and learning from one another are integral parts of the development process.

## Coding challenge questions (Ones you write code for)
1. FizzBuzz: As you mentioned, it's a simple problem used to test basic programming logic and looping constructs.
2. Fibonacci Series: This problem assesses your understanding of recursion and dynamic programming.
3. Palindrome Detection: You might be asked to determine whether a given string or number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
4. Reverse a String: Reverse a given string, either in-place or by creating a new string.
5. Anagram Detection: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters, rearranged).
6. String Manipulation: Problems involving string manipulation like counting characters, finding substrings, or reversing words.
7. Array Manipulation: Operations on arrays, such as finding the maximum subarray sum or rotating an array.
8. Linked List Problems: 
    1. Reverse a singly linked list.
    2. Detect a cycle in a singly linked list
Tasks involving singly or doubly linked lists, such as reversing a linked list or detecting cycles.
    (Problem: Reverse a singly linked list.
    You are given the head of a singly linked list. Reverse the list and return its head.)
9. Tree Problems: Tree-related problems like tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, post-order), finding the lowest common ancestor, or checking if a binary tree is balanced.
10. Sorting Algorithms: Implement or analyze sorting algorithms like Quicksort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort.
11. Searching Algorithms: Implement or analyze searching algorithms like Binary Search.
12. Dynamic Programming: Solve problems using dynamic programming techniques, like finding the longest common subsequence or solving the knapsack problem.
13. Graph Problems: Problems related to graph traversal, shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford), or detecting cycles in a graph.
14. Hashing: Utilizing hash tables to solve problems like finding duplicate elements or implementing a cache.
15. Bit Manipulation: Tasks involving bitwise operations, such as finding the single non-repeating number in an array.
16. Math Problems: Math-related questions like finding prime numbers, computing factorials, or solving equations.
17. Recursion: Problems that require you to solve them recursively, such as calculating factorials or generating permutations.
18. System Design Questions: Design a system or component, considering scalability, performance, and trade-offs.
19.  Concurrency and Multithreading: Problems related to managing concurrent processes or threads safely.
20. Object-Oriented Design: Design and implement classes and interfaces to solve specific problems.
21. Database Design: Design and query databases, create ER diagrams, or optimize database queries.
22. Real-World Application: Some interviews may involve solving problems that mimic real-world scenarios related to the company's domain.

## Conceptual Coding Interview Questions (Answers still in development)
Apart from just being able to code an answer, it is cruicial the a coder understands the fundemental concepts of computer science. These questions will work to test that knowledge:
<li>
    <ol> What is a data structure? </ol>
    <ol> What is an array? </ol>
    <ol> What is a linked list? </ol>
    <ol> What is the difference between an array and a linked list? </ol>
    <ol> What is LIFO? </ol>
    <ol> What is FIFO? </ol>
    <ol> What is a stack? </ol>
    <ol> What are binary trees? </ol>
    <ol> What are binary search trees? </ol>
    <ol> What is object-oriented programming? </ol>
    <ol> What is the purpose of a loop in programming? </ol>
    <ol> What is a conditional statement? </ol>
    <ol> What is debugging? </ol>
    <ol> What is recursion? </ol>
    <ol> What are the differences between linear and non-linear data structures? </ol>
</li>
In interviews, get ready for some conceptual questions thrown at you by recruiters or hiring managers. They want to see if you're cool with the basic stuff in computer science.
Think about stuff like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. Also, those old pals sorting and searching algorithms, they might pop up.
To get ready, just brush up on these concepts and try explaining them casually to someone who's not tech-savvy. Easy peasy, right?
